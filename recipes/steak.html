    <h2>STEAK</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>It’s as simple as this: while the steak is searing in the pan, throw in butter, garlic and thyme and baste continuously as the steak finishes cooking. The garlic-thyme infused butter does all sorts of wonderful things to the steak, seeping into the cracks and crevices, and adhering to the crust of the steak</p>
    <p>It’s pan seared steak made Outrageous – and that’s Outrageous with a capital “O”!.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 – 2 boneless ribeye or scotch fillet , 2.5 cm / 1″ thick, approx 300g/10 each/(Note 1)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil </li>
        <li>Salt and pepper </li>
        <li>75g / 5 tbsp unsalted butter , cut into 1.25cm / 1/2″ cubes (Note 2)</li>
        <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme or 3 sprigs rosemary </li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves , peeled and smashed to split (Note 3) </li>
        
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Bring to room temp: Take the steak out of the fridge 30 minutes prior to bring to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Dry steaks: Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
    <li>Heat skillet: Heat oil in a heavy based skillet over high heat until it is very hot – you should see smoke!.</li>
    <li>Season: Sprinkle each side of the steak generously with salt and pepper, then immediately place in the skillet.</li>
    <li>Sear Side 1: Cook for 2 – 2.5 minutes until you get a great crust, then turn.</li>
    <li>Garlic Butter: Leave for 1 minute, then push steaks to one side and toss in butter, garlic and thyme. BE CAREFUL – the thyme will sputter! </li>
    <li>Baste: As soon as the butter is melted, continuously spoon the butter over the steak until it’s cooked to your liking – 2 minutes in total for the 2nd side for medium rare (52C/125F) </li>
    <li>Basting also renders fat on the side of the steak – use tongs to sear the edges at the end if you want it browned more. </li>
    <li>Rest: Transfer steak to a plate and cover loosely with foil, rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Serve steak with a bit of the butter from the skillet drizzled on top. Pictured in post with Crispy Smashed Potatoes.
